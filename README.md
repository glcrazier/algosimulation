# glcrazier's 3D tour

I'm very glad that you can see this. I hope you can learn something from here.

## Purpose

This repo is to demonstrate how to build a 3D world from scratch. Here I'm gonna use OpenGL|ES 3.0 to build the entire stuff. You can try it if you have an Android device which supports OpenGL|ES 3.0.

## Contents

### Startup Environment
The best way to learn how to set up environment is to download a sample from Android developer site and use that as a template. To render the simplest thing such as a triangle, you need at least to do the following:
* Set up EGL which provides rendering context for OpenGL ES.
* Set up view port.
* Set up vertex and fragment shaders.
* Compile and link shaders to a program which is used by OpenGL ES.
* Create and bind a vertices array to  that contains vertices of a triangle.
* At last, invoke draw command to render.
